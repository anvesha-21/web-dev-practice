<h4>
🍯 Ghevar – The Royal Dessert of Rajasthan
Crisp, golden, and soaked in sweetness — Ghevar is not just a dessert, it's an experience rooted in the royal kitchens of Rajasthan. Crafted with a delicate batter of flour, ghee, and chilled water, and deep-fried in a special mold to form its signature honeycomb texture, Ghevar is a true art of patience and perfection.

Once fried to a golden crisp, it’s generously soaked in fragrant sugar syrup and topped with silver varq, slivered dry fruits, and a dash of cardamom. Often adorned with creamy rabri or saffron strands, Ghevar is the crown jewel of Teej and Raksha Bandhan celebrations.

🌼 Crispy. Sweet. Regal. One bite of our handcrafted Ghevar, and you’ll taste the heritage of India in its most festive form.</h4>
